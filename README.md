This repository contains the core smart contracts for the Morpho Protocol V0 ü¶ã.

## Testing

First, install dependencies with:

```
yarn
```

Refer to the `env.example` for the required environment variable.

Tests are run against a fork of the Polygon Mainnet, which allows us to interact directly with Cream. Note that you need to have an RPC provider that have access to Polygon.
We aim a test coverage > 90% of all functions.

‚ö†Ô∏è Tests cannot substituted to coverage as the coverage command as contracts are compiled without optimization and can alter some patterns.

To run test, use this command:

```
yarn test:cream:polygon
```

For coverage, run:

```
yarn coverage
```

## Code Formatting

We use prettier with the default configuration mentionned in the [Solidity Prettier Plugin](https://github.com/prettier-solidity/prettier-plugin-solidity).
We recommend developers using VSCODE to set their local config as below:

```
{
	"editor.formatOnSave": true,
	"solidity.formatter": "prettier",
	"editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
}
```

In doing so the code will be formatted on each save.

We use Husky hook to format code before being pushed to any remote branch to enforce coding style among all developers.

## Contributing

In this section, you will find some guidelines to read before contributing to the project.

### Creating issues and PRs

Guidelines for creating issues and PRs:

- Issues must be created and labelled with relevant labels (type of issues, high/medium/low priority, etc.).
- Nothing should be pushed directly to the `main` branch.
- Pull requests must be created before and branch names must follow this pattern: `feat/<feature-name>`, `test/<test-name>` or `fix/<fix-name>`. `docs`, `ci` can also be used. The goal is to have clear branches names and make easier their management.
- PRs must be labelled with the relevant labels.
- Issues must be linked to PRs so that once the PR is merged related issues are closed at the same time.
- Reviewers must be added to the PR.
- For commits, we use the [conventional commits pattern](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

### Before merging a PR

Before merging a PR:

- PR must have been reviewed by reviewers. The must deliver a complete report on the smart contracts (see the section below).
- Comments and requested changes must have been resolved.
- PR must have been approved by every reviewers.
- CI must pass.

For smart contract reviews, a complete report must have been done, not just a reading of the changes in the code. This is very important as a simple change on one line of code can bring dramatic consequences on a smart contracts (bad copy/paste have already lead to hacks).
For the guidelines on "How to review contracts and write a report?", you can follow this [link](https://abiding-machine-635.notion.site/Solidity-Guidelines-7c9a201413df47d6b72577374f93a697).

By default, PR are rebased with `main` before merging to keep a clean historic of commits and the branch is deleted.

## Deploy a contract on a network

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
```

## Publish and verify a contract on Etherscan

An etherscn API key is required to verify the contract and placed into your `.env` local file.
The right arguments of the constructor of the smart contract to verify must be write inside `arguments.js`. Then you can run the following command to verify a contract:

```
npx hardhat verify --network <network-name> --constructor-args scripts/arguments.js <contract-address>
npx hardhat verify --network <network-name> --constructor-args scripts/arguments.js --contract contracts/Example.sol:ExampleContract <contract-address>
```

The second is necessary if contracts with different names share the same ABI.
